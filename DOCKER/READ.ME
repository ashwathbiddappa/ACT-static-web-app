## Dockerfile Explanation

- **Base Image**: We are using a lightweight NGINX image based on Alpine Linux.
  - Alpine makes the image smaller and faster.

- **Copying the HTML File**: The `index.html` file is copied into the container so it can be served by NGINX.

- **Expose Port 80**: We expose port 80 because NGINX uses this port to serve web traffic.

- **CMD Command**: We use `CMD` to run NGINX in the foreground. This keeps the container running and serving the page.
