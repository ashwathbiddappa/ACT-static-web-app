Prometheus will collect metrics like CPU, memory, and disk usage from your Kubernetes cluster.
Grafana provides easy-to-read dashboards to visualize these metrics.
Key Metrics to Monitor:
CPU usage: Monitor CPU load across nodes/pods.
Memory usage: Check total and available memory.
Disk usage: Track disk space usage on nodes.
To get custom metrics (like application-specific metrics), we  need to install the Prometheus Adapter and expose custom metrics from your application.
